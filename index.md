## Underrated builders
I've met quite some people on my journey. Here are some of them.
* [lesscrappylife.com](http://lesscrappylife.com) -- A great website on self-improvement. The maker event built a discord community. 
* [The Idea Of](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJ9ETrebJG7WpXhqqGBrNgg) -- YouTube Channel that has made long-form content on Nassim Taleb. 

## Why this site
This site is my little rebellion against flat design. When Apple announced iOS7, it left skeuomorphism, the tactile design. Within this flat design, there isn't a whole lot of wiggle room. In the depths of the internet, I found a theme, based on a newspaper French Revolution Era, L'ami du peuple, by Jean-Paul Murat.
