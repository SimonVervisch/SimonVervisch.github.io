## My Best Articles


## My favorite books
* [**The Incerto**](https://www.goodreads.com/series/164555-incerto) by *Nassim Nicholas Taleb*. These books have influenced my on so many levels. Thanks to this book, I appreciate the small more. I've learnt to build redundancy, It made me appreciate organic things more (not only the food).
* [**Make it Stick**](https://www.amazon.com/Make-Stick-Science-Successful-Learning/dp/0674729013) by *Peter C. Brown*. After reading this book, my grades immensily improved. It changed my view on learning and how I used to go about it in a wrong way
* [**Master the Day**](https://www.amazon.com/Master-Day-Better-Power-Habits-ebook/dp/B011HNR91Q) by *Alexander Heyne*. This was the first self-help book I read. Habits are everything, they free you. Break the things you do on a daily basis down to it's essence and repeat. Thanks to this book, I can keep things more consistent.
* [**Quantum Memory Power**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/245827.Quantum_Memory_Power) by *Dominic O'Brien* (& [**Moonwalking with Einstein**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moonwalking_with_Einstein) by *Joshua Foer*). Both these book have helped me realise the immense potential of my brain (seems like a bad commercial, but it's true). We're very good at visualising, so use the force of mind palaces.
* [**Why We Sleep**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Why_We_Sleep) by *Matthew Walker*. This book helped me to see that I slept too little. Sleeping well is important. It boosts your learning.
* [**The Analects**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analects) by *Confucius*. The book which East-Asian (China, Vietnam and Japan...) culture is based upon. I agreed with a lot of principles laid out.

* [Gregory Muller](https://www.gregmuller.net/starthere) -- He's a fiction writer that just finished his first book. He's also learning programming.

All of them are highly interested in the world.
